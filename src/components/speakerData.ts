    about:`The need for ever-increasing bandwidth is driving the research community to explore new spectrum frontiers. The sub-terahertz and terahertz bands (0.1–10 THz) offer a vast swath of untapped spectrum that could be used for many innovative communication and sensing applications. Additionally, the shorter wavelengths and the non-negligible photon energy of terahertz radiation open the door to innovative applications across scales. Over the last decade, remarkable progress in electronic, photonic, and plasmonic technologies has narrowed the terahertz technology gap. Moreover, in-depth studies on terahertz signal propagation, combining physics-based and data-driven approaches, have dispelled misconceptions surrounding the terahertz channel. However, several communication roadblocks must be overcome to unleash the spectrum above 100 GHz. This talk will follow a bottom-up approach to highlight innovative solutions and open challenges for terahertz communications and sensing systems on the ground, in the air, and in space. First, we delve into wavefront engineering for near-field THz links, showcasing novel beam types, including self-healing Bessel and curving Airy beams and discuss the unique opportunities these beams offer for short-range, high-capacity networks. Second, we demonstrate the advantageous role of THz frequencies in satellite communication networks, highlighting their potential for high-speed access links, and the upcoming, first-of-its-kind, TeraLink experimental mission.`,

Title: Signal Processing for Integrated Sensing and Communications
Abstract: In this talk, we focus on the recent developments toward integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). We consider a broad definition of coexistence, which covers ISAC, collaborative communications, and sensing with interference. Toward fully realizing the coexistence of the two systems, optimization of resources for both new/futuristic sensing and wireless communications modalities is crucial. These synergistic approaches that exploit the interplay between state sensing and communications are both driving factors and opportunities for many current signal processing and information-theoretic techniques. In addition, a large body of prior works considers colocated ISAC systems while distributed systems remain relatively unexamined. Building on the existing approaches, the talk focuses on highlighting emerging scenarios in collaborative and distributed ISAC, particularly at mm-Wave and THz frequencies, highly dynamic vehicular/automotive environments that would benefit from information exchange between the two systems. It presents the architectures and possible methodologies for mutually beneficial distributed co-existence and co-design, including sensor fusion and heterogeneously distributed radar and communications. The talk also considers recent developments such as the deployment of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) in ISAC, 5G systems, passive internet-of-things, and ISAC secrecy rate optimization. This talk aims to draw the attention of the radar, communications, and signal processing communities toward an emerging area, which can benefit from the cross-fertilization of ideas in distributed systems.

    title: "Software Synthesis from Dataflow Schedule Graphs",
    about: `In dataflow-based design processes for signal processing and machine learning (SPML), scheduling is a critical task that affects practical measures of performance, including latency, throughput, energy consumption, memory requirements, and processor utilization. Dataflow schedule graphs (DSGs) provide a formal abstraction for representing schedules in dataflow-based design processes. The DSG abstraction allows designers to model a schedule as a separate dataflow graph, thereby providing a formal, abstract (platform and language-independent) representation for the schedule. In this presentation, we review the DSG representation, and introduce a design methodology for embedded SPML systems that is based on explicit specifications of application graphs and schedules as cooperating dataflow models. We also develop new software synthesis techniques for automatically deriving efficient implementations from these coupled application and schedule models. We demonstrate the proposed methodology and software synthesis techniques through various experiments, including an example involving real time detection of people and vehicles using acoustic and seismic sensors.`

    title:"Reliable Future Aviation Communications",
    about:"Growth in aviation will require advances in air-ground and air-air communications, navigation, and surveillance (CNS). Projects such as NASA’s Advanced Air Mobility (AAM), which is aimed at the transportation of both cargo and people in low-altitude flights in and around urban areas, require extremely high-reliability links, often with low latencies. In this presentation, we provide background on aviation trends and estimated aviation link quality requirements, briefly discuss AAM system requirements, then focus on reliable air-ground (AG) communications. For this we discuss both intrinsic challenges such as wireless channel impairments and spectrum constraints, as well as extrinsic challenges such as interference, both unintentional and intentional (i.e., jamming). We summarize reliability techniques at the network and data link layers, then turn to the physical layer, and discuss in some detail AG channel effects, transmission security (transec), and anti-jam (AJ) techniques. We illustrate that by taking an adversary’s perspective we can improve link design and operation. The talk will conclude with comments on the future potential of machine learning and artificial intelligence, along with other areas for future work."

    title:"Magnetics and Insulation Design for Power Electronics",
    about:`In power electronic applications, electromagnetic devices such as transformers and inductors are essential for galvanic isolation, voltage transformation, filtering action, and power flow control.  The size and cost of these devices depend on how efficiently these components are designed and manufactured. The selection of appropriate magnetic and insulating materials is of paramount importance, which is primarily decided by the intrinsic material properties and various kinds of stresses during operation. Hysteresis, eddy, and anomalous components make up the total magnetic loss. Skin and proximity losses can become critical at high frequencies associated with power electronics, and their effect on performance parameters can be significant. Design of insulation in components used in power converter systems with silicon carbide devices is an important aspect due to repetitive voltage pulses with high rise times. To overcome these challenges, a deep understanding of relevant concepts, including the theories of magnetization processes, eddy currents, and partial discharges, is essential. Furthermore, thermal issues impact loading limits of the magnetic and insulating materials, and hence decide reliability and life expectancy of the power electronic converter systems. The talk focuses on challenges in the various aspects of designing the devices, enumerates current practices followed in overcoming them, and highlights emerging trends.`

    title:"Chip and Artificial Intelligence: A Symbiosis",
    about:"The accelerating evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is deeply intertwined with rapid advancements in semiconductor technology. A symbiotic relationship between AI and chip design, highlights how each drives progress in the other. On one hand, AI applications demand immense computational power, prompting innovations in chip architectures—such as Graphic Processing Units (GPU), Tensor Processing Units, neuromorphic processors, and edge AI chips—that are optimized for parallel processing and machine learning tasks. Chip design, spec-to-layout flow,  is iterative in nature. Large, complex System on Chips are divided into many modules. Each module proceeds through making of microarchitecture, RTL design and verification, logic synthesis, timing analysis, power analysis, floor-planning, placement, clock tree distribution, routing, and final signoff. AI is increasingly being used to automate and enhance chip design, in all the steps, reducing development time and increasing efficiency. This mutual reinforcement is accelerating both fields, enabling breakthroughs in autonomous systems, healthcare, defence, space and beyond. As AI models grow in complexity and ubiquity, the co-evolution of chips and AI will be central to the next wave of technological innovation."
